# Data Directory

This directory is used for local data storage (CSV files, SQLite databases, etc.)

Common data files in this directory (e.g., `.csv`, `.db`, `.sqlite`) are ignored by `.gitignore` to prevent committing large datasets.
This placeholder file ensures the directory structure is maintained in version control.
