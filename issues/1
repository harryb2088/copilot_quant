## Backtest Results Log System

### Description
We need to implement a system to keep a log of all backtested strategies along with their respective settings and performance metrics. This log will help in tracking the effectiveness of various strategies over time and facilitate further analysis. 

### Requirements
- Log of backtested strategies
- Include respective settings for each strategy
- Performance metrics to be recorded:
  - Profit/Loss
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Max Drawdown
  
This will greatly enhance our ability to evaluate and refine our trading strategies based on past performance.
