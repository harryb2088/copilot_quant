markers =
    unit: marks tests as unit tests (fast, no external dependencies)
    integration: marks tests as integration tests requiring network access (deselect with '-m "not integration"')
    live_api: marks tests that make real API calls to external services (deselect with '-m "not live_api"')
    performance: marks tests as performance and load tests (deselect with '-m "not performance"')
    slow: marks tests as slow-running tests
